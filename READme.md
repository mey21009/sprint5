# Overview

I was planning on making a risk style came for IOS but my xcode isn't working on my computer. I also tried to use it on another computer but the macOS is too old for it to work. I will try to work on it over the summer on another family member's computer. Instead I changed this at the last minute to work on a webpage with several different games on it. It doesn't look good but it has some basics and sort of works.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code to set everything up. I also used a lot of different youtube videos and w3 tutorials.

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
